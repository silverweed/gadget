Experimenting GL rendering + physics with D.

### Building

You'll need the following packages:

1. [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) and CSFML.
2. [dub](https://code.dlang.org/download)
3. An OpenGL implementation

Once you've set it up, follow these steps:

1. `cd` into the root directory, where `dub.json` is;  
2. `dub upgrade` (may be optional, but do it just in case);  
3. `dub`.

If you're lucky, you should see something resembling this:

If that's not the case...it's ok. Gadget is still super-WIP and things break and change all the time. Just come back later I guess :)
